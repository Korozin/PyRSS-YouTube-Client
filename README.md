# PyRSS-YouTube-Client
an RSS Client in Python to download and view YouTube content using Yrs for the backend.

Basically this uses a Python Package called YRS to fetch and use RSS Feed from YouTube - I just made a GUI to work with it.


### Requirements

`PyQt5`
`Yrs` (Yrs is auto-installed upon running, but PyQt5 is not.)


### To Run

It should be pretty self-explanatory to run open CMD / Terminal and type

``` python
python PyRSS.py
```

and it should check from a automatically generated config file whether or not YRS is installed. If not it'll go ahead and run

``` python
pip install youtube-rss-subscriber
```

for you. Or you can just run it yourself. I really don't care.

The rest should be easy enough to figure out on your own.
