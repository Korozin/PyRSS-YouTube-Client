# PyRSS-YouTube-Client
An RSS client GUI for use with Python to download and view YouTube content using "YRS" as its backend. 

It utilises a package called "YRS" to fetch the RSS feed for YouTube.

## Requirements:
- [Python v3.10.8 (currently working)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/)
- Windows or Linux operating system

## Dependencies:
- [YouTube RSS Subscriber (YRS)](https://github.com/miquelruiz/youtube-rss-subscriber)
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

(The dependencies should automatically install when the script is ran for the first time.)


## Usage:

Getting "PyRSS" to run is very self-explanatory. Open a new command prompt/terminal window and type:

``` python
python PyRSS.py
```

And the script will check to see whether or not all dependencies are installed. If not, then it'll go ahead and run the following commands:

``` python
pip install youtube-rss-subscriber
pip install PyQt5
pip install requests
```

Alternatively, if you're having troubles with getting one or more to install, then you can manually run the commands yourself.

The rest should be easy to figure out once you get going.
